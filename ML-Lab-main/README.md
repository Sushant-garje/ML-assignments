# ML-Lab
## Assignment 1 
* Perform the following operations using R/Python on suitable data sets:
1. Read data from different formats (like csv, xls)
2. Find Shape of Data
3. Find Missing Values
4. Find data type of each column
5. Finding out Zero's
6. Indexing and selecting data, sort data,
7. Describe attributes of data, checking data types of each column,
8. Counting unique values of data, format of each column, converting variable
data type (e.g. from long to short, vice versa)

## Assignment 2
* Perform the following operations using R/Python on the data sets:
1. Compute and display summary statistics for each feature available in the dataset.
(e.g. minimum value, maximum value, mean, range, standard deviation, variance
and percentiles
2. Illustrate the feature distributions using histogram.
3. Data cleaning, Data integration, Data transformation, Data model building (e.g.
Classification)

## Assignment 3
* Visualize the data using R/Python by plotting the graphs for assignment no. 1 and 2.
Consider a suitable data set. Use Scatter plot, Bar plot, Box plot, Pie chart, Line
Chart.

## Assignment 4
* Apply appropriate ML algorithm on a dataset collected in a cosmetics shop showing
details of customers to predict customer response for special offer. Create confusion
matrix based on above data and find
1. Accuracy
2. Precision
3. Recall
4. F-1 score

## Assignment 5
* Write a program to do following: Data Set:
https://www.kaggle.com/shwetabh123/mall-customers This dataset givesthe
data of Income and money spent by the customers visiting a shopping mall.
The data set contains Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, Spending
Score. Therefore, asa mall owner you need to find the group of people who
are the profitable customers for the mallowner. Apply at least two clustering
algorithms (based on Spending Score) to find the group ofcustomers.
1. Apply Data pre-processing
2. Perform data-preparation (Train-Test Split)
3. Apply Machine Learning Algorithm

## Assignment 6
* Assignment on Regression technique. Download temperature data from below
link.
https://www.kaggle.com/venky73/temperaturesof-india?select=temperatures.
csv This data consists of temperatures of INDIA averaging the temperatures
of all places month wise. Temperatures values are recorded in CELSIUS
1. Apply Linear Regression using suitable library function and predict the
Month-wise temperature.
2. Assess the performance of regression models using MSE, MAE and R-Square
metrics
3. Visualize simple regression model.

## Assignment 7
* Assignment on Classification technique Every year many students give the GRE
exam to get admission in foreign Universities. The data set contains GRE
Scores (out of 340), TOEFL Scores (out of 120), University Rating (out of
5), Statement of Purpose strength (out of 5), Letter of Recommendation
strength (out of 5), Undergraduate GPA (out of 10), Research Experience
(0=no, 1=yes), Admitted (0=no, 1=yes). Admitted is the target variable. Data
Set: https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions The
counselor of the firm is supposed check whether the student will get an
admission or not based on his/her GRE score and Academic Score. So to
help the counselor to take appropriate decisions build a machine learning
model classifier using Decision tree to predict whether a student will get
admission or not.
1. Apply Data pre-processing (Label Encoding, Data Transformation....)
techniques if necessary.
2. Perform data-preparation (Train-Test Split)
3. Apply Machine Learning Algorithm
4. Evaluate Model.
